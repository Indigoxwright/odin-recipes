    <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>This tart makes for an impressive dessert, 
         yet its so easy to make! The base is a bit 
         like handling play dough! The two layers are 
         very simple too and you can make them even 
         simpler by using sliced raw strawberries
         instead of a strawberry jelly layer. Your call!</p>
